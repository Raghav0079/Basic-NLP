#  Natural Language Processing

This repository explores various machine learning and deep learning techniques applied in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It covers essential preprocessing methods such as tokenization, stopwords removal, lemmatization, and stemming, which form the foundation of NLP tasks. By understanding and implementing these techniques, users can preprocess text data efficiently and build better-performing models for various NLP applications.

## Features

- Comprehensive implementation of NLP preprocessing techniques
- Practical examples of machine learning and deep learning approaches for NLP
- Focus on creating robust NLP models using systematic data preprocessing

## Techniques

### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of dividing a text into smaller units called tokens, such as words, phrases, or sentences. These tokens serve as building blocks for further analysis. Tokenization is crucial in converting unstructured text into a structured format suitable for computational models. It can be customized based on the language and the specific requirements of the task, such as handling special characters, punctuation, or numeric values. For example, a sentence like "Natural Language Processing is fun!" can be tokenized into individual words: ["Natural", "Language", "Processing", "is", "fun"].

### Stopwords Removal
Stopwords are commonly used words that carry little meaningful information in the context of NLP tasks, such as "the," "is," "and," or "of." Removing stopwords reduces data size and minimizes noise, allowing models to focus on more relevant words. While stopwords removal is beneficial for many tasks, it should be done with caution for applications where these words may have semantic importance. For example, in sentiment analysis, words like "not" could significantly change the meaning of a sentence and should not be removed indiscriminately.

### Lemmatization
Lemmatization is the process of transforming words into their base or dictionary form, known as a lemma. Unlike stemming, lemmatization considers the context and grammar of the word, ensuring that the resulting lemma is an actual word. For instance, "running" and "ran" can both be reduced to "run." By grouping together inflected forms of a word, lemmatization helps NLP models identify patterns and relationships in the data while maintaining linguistic accuracy.

### Stemming
Stemming is a rule-based process of stripping affixes (prefixes or suffixes) from words to reduce them to their root form. This technique is computationally efficient but may sometimes produce non-standard or incomplete words. For example, "playing," "played," and "plays" may all be reduced to "play," while "generously" might become "gener." Despite its limitations, stemming is widely used in scenarios where speed is prioritized over linguistic accuracy, such as search engines or text clustering.
