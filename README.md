## Project Overview
Natural Language Processing is a rapidly evolving field that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This project aims to provide:
- Easy-to-use scripts for core NLP preprocessing tasks
- Example workflows for building and evaluating NLP models
- Educational resources for beginners and practitioners


## Features
- Comprehensive implementation of NLP preprocessing techniques
- Practical examples of machine learning and deep learning approaches for NLP
- Focus on creating robust NLP models using systematic data preprocessing
- Well-documented code and step-by-step guides
- Ready-to-use scripts for experimentation


## Techniques

### Tokenization
Tokenization divides text into smaller units called tokens (words, phrases, or sentences). This step converts unstructured text into a structured format for analysis. Example:
```python
from nlp_toolkit import tokenize
sentence = "Natural Language Processing is fun!"
tokens = tokenize(sentence)
print(tokens)  # ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'fun']
```

### Stopwords Removal
Stopwords are common words ("the", "is", "and") that add little value to NLP tasks. Removing them reduces noise and data size. Example:
```python
from nlp_toolkit import remove_stopwords
tokens = ["Natural", "Language", "Processing", "is", "fun"]
filtered = remove_stopwords(tokens)
print(filtered)  # ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'fun']
```

### Lemmatization
Lemmatization transforms words to their base (dictionary) form, considering context and grammar. Example:
```python
from nlp_toolkit import lemmatize
words = ["running", "ran", "runs"]
lemmas = [lemmatize(w) for w in words]
print(lemmas)  # ['run', 'run', 'run']
```

### Stemming
Stemming strips affixes from words to reduce them to their root form. It is fast but may produce non-standard words. Example:
```python
from nlp_toolkit import stem
words = ["playing", "played", "plays"]
stems = [stem(w) for w in words]
print(stems)  # ['play', 'play', 'play']
```


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip
- Recommended: virtualenv or conda

## Dataset
- Place your text data in the `data/` directory.
- Example datasets: [NLTK corpora](https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/), [Kaggle NLP datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=nlp)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/Raghav0079/Basic-NLP.git
	cd Basic-NLP
	```
2. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```


## Usage

### Preprocessing Example
```python
from nlp_toolkit import tokenize, remove_stopwords, lemmatize, stem
text = "Dogs are running in the park."
tokens = tokenize(text)
filtered = remove_stopwords(tokens)
lemmas = [lemmatize(w) for w in filtered]
stems = [stem(w) for w in filtered]
print("Tokens:", tokens)
print("Filtered:", filtered)
print("Lemmas:", lemmas)
print("Stems:", stems)
```

### Training Models
Refer to the `code/` directory for scripts and notebooks demonstrating model training and evaluation.
